Make sure you backup your bot_cycle.tin and bot_load.tin files before overwriting.

Drop the charname_scalers.tin file into the .tt/3k/char/ folder and rename it to match your character, e.g. inix_scalers.tin.

'scalers' to view your configured scalers.
'setscaler <steppername> <level>' to set the scaler level for each stepper.
'scaleall <level>' to set all your scaler levels for any stepper which has previously been configured (it won't automatically add stepper names).
'scaleoff' to turn off the automatic scaling when starting a stepper.
'scaleon' to turn on the automatic scaling when starting a stepper.

The 'bc' command and the area cycle pane will update to show the configured scaler value in brackets.
